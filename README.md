This project is a responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide a modern and interactive user experience. The website features a sleek navigation bar, an engaging hero section with call-to-action buttons, and flexible grid layouts for displaying content dynamically. Smooth animations and hover effects enhance interactivity, while media queries ensure compatibility across different screen sizes. The combination of these technologies demonstrates the effective use of responsive design principles, clean layouts, and reusable components to create a visually appealing and functional website.
